# Vara — Journey Architecture & Build Roadmap
**Version 3.0 | September 1, 2026 | Source of truth for the journey build**

**Supersedes** `Vara_Today_IA_Restructure_Roadmap_v2.md` on IA, tabs, the Today surface, the
weekly loop, and phase/capacity semantics. Supersedes `Vara_Refactor_Plan.md` §3 (IA), §4 (core
loop first-run), §5 (onboarding quest), and §7 (pillar inventory). Everything either document says
about tokens, voice, guardrails, and engine separation still holds. Where this document and Jen's
*Journey Architecture* (Aug 31) differ, this document reflects the Sept 1 resolutions and is the
build reference; her document remains the framework reference.

Status tags: **[Done]** merged to main · **[Next]** active slice · **[Queued]** specced, not
started · **[Content-gated]** blocked on Jen · **[Kyle-gated]** blocked on a ledger item ·
**[Post-beta]** out of this build.

---

## 1. The model (paste-stable statement)

The onboarding pick becomes the **destination**: `focus | calm | routines | energy`. The journey
is four **phases** in fixed order, `remove | recover | rewire | refocus`, always displayed in the
user's destination language via a `(phase, destination)` lookup; the framework words never appear
in UI. **Every practice is runnable at all times.** Phase state controls what Today serves and what
the map emphasizes; it never blocks a tool.

The **daily capacity loop is untouched** and is the behavior instrument. The **weekly reset
survives**, loses the outcome pick and ratings, and becomes the phase check-in: the felt instrument.

**Advancement** is offered when cumulative consistent days in the phase reach **8**, or **14**
calendar days pass, whichever comes first. Never automatic. Always skippable forward by the user.
**Adjustment** is offered after **two consecutive** weekly reads of "not moving"; constrained choice
inside the phase first, moving on second, staying third.

**No counter is ever visible.** Practices tab is the journey map: vertical stack, destination
titles, visible state labels (DONE / WHERE YOU ARE / AHEAD / SKIPPED), one-line gloss, Start here
collapsing after first play. Today gains a quiet journey line, a collapsing Start here, and moments
of joy below the fold (one tap, never counted back). Reframe layer, Insights data view, referral,
aging photo: post-beta. The daily goal chip (mockup v1) does not exist.

Mockups: `Vara_Journey_Mockups_v2.html` (frames A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1).

---

## 2. What the audits established (baseline, not opinion)

From the two CC read-only reports (Aug 31):

- The weekly loop is **14 files plus one mixed service**; the daily loop depends on it through
  **four scalar reads** on `WeeklyCycle` and **one count query** (`countWeeklyCyclesForOutcome`).
- `dailyLogs` is keyed `${userId}_${date}` with **no cycle reference**. It survives untouched.
- `PROTOCOL_MATRIX` is a pure `Record<OutcomeKey, Record<CapacityTier, ProtocolVariant[]>>`;
  re-keying the outer axis touches two string templates and one persisted field
  (`WeeklyCycle.protocolId`) that is itself being dropped.
- `UserPrivate.activeOutcome` is **write-only**. Free to redefine as `destination`.
- Focus screens (`FocusTimer`, `FocusDayBlocks`, `FocusTasks`) are gated by **nothing but the
  paywall**. No work needed to keep them runnable.
- `VideoPlayerModal` + `useVideoSource` are finished and content-agnostic; **no container exists**.
- `protocolSessions` is written by four callers and read by one **uncalled** symbol.
- `DailyReflectionCard` and `FirstShiftFooter` are built and suppressed by flag.
- No client-side crisis pre-check exists on any input path.
- **Nine of thirteen** constructs in Jen's "survives unchanged" list are spec-only. Practice
  substitution is **rejected in code** (`resolve.ts:140`). Both CC reports are to be shared with
  Jen's instance as the "what exists on main" baseline.
- The weekly loop is **live in production** for beta testers. Retirement is a migration.

---

## 3. Data model

### 3.1 New: `journeyStates/{uid}` (one doc per user, new collection)

Separate collection, not a `userPrivate` field: `userPrivate` is mid-migration (slices 3–4
pending) and must not grow during the window.

```
journeyStates/{uid}
  userId             string             // == uid; required so the deleteAccount
                                        // userId== sweep matches; rules validate
                                        // data.userId == {uid} (slice 1 fix)
  destination        DestinationKey     // focus | calm | routines | energy
  phaseKey           PhaseKey           // remove | recover | rewire | refocus
  enteredAt          Timestamp          // current phase entry
  history            PhaseHistoryEntry[] // { phaseKey, enteredAt, exitedAt, exitReason }
                                        // exitReason: advanced | skipped | adjusted_back
  skipped            PhaseKey[]         // phases passed without completing (map shows SKIPPED)
  advanceOfferedAt   Timestamp | null   // last offer shown for current phase
  advanceDeclinedAt  Timestamp | null   // "stay a while longer"
  adjustOfferedAt    Timestamp | null
  adjustDeclinedAt   Timestamp | null   // "keep going as is"
  createdAt, updatedAt
```

**Counters are derived, never stored.** `consistentDays` = count of `dailyLogs` with
`protocolCompleted === true` and `date >= enteredAt`. `calendarDays` = today − `enteredAt`.
`adjustDue` = the two most recent weekly reset docs since `enteredAt` both have
`phaseRead === 'not_moving'`. A stored counter can drift; a derivation cannot.

### 3.2 Rekeyed: the protocol matrix

- `OutcomeKey` retires as a matrix axis. New `PhaseKey` is the outer key.
- New `DestinationKey = 'focus' | 'calm' | 'routines' | 'energy'` (rename `stress → calm`).
- `ProtocolVariant.id` template becomes `${phase}-${capacity}`; `variantKey` becomes
  `${phase}-${capacity}-${timeClass}`. `ProtocolId` union in `analyticsEvents.ts` rekeyed.
- Destination shapes **ordering within a cell**, never membership: `orderForDestination(variants,
  destination)` is a pure function over an optional `destinationWeight` on variants.
- `selectProtocol(phase, capacity, time, destination)`; `representativeProtocol(phase, capacity)`
  keeps no time parameter (unchanged rule).
- `applyQuickWin` and `countWeeklyCyclesForOutcome` **retire**. Early-phase gentleness is a content
  property Jen authors, not an engine rule.
- Content re-tag (data, not rewrite): `focus → refocus`; `stress + energy → recover`;
  `routines` variants → `recover` (routines are recovery infrastructure per Jen §5). `remove` and
  `rewire` are **net-new** cells. Recompute `unauthoredVariants()` after re-tag; that number is the
  content commitment.

### 3.3 Rekeyed: display strings

`OUTCOME_LABELS` (single-key) is replaced by `PHASE_DISPLAY: Record<PhaseKey,
Record<DestinationKey, { title, short, gloss }>>` — 16 combinations × 3 lengths. `title` is the map
card; `short` is the route strip and Today journey line; `gloss` is the one-line under the title.
Single source. All 48 strings are Jen's; the copy sentinel count increments in the same commit.

### 3.4 Changed: `weeklyCycles` → weekly reset record

Collection name stays (no migration). Per-doc: **keep** `weekStart`, `weekEnd`, `closeCompletedAt`,
`closeNote`; **add** `phaseRead: 'moving' | 'same' | 'not_moving'` and `phaseKeyAtRead`; **stop
writing** `outcome`, `capacityInitial`, `capacityCurrent`, `protocolId`, `ratingFocus/Recovery/
Energy`, `adjustmentSelected`. Fields stay optional on the type so legacy docs still parse. The
first weekly cycle is still created at onboarding for cadence; it no longer carries an outcome.
`floorMet` survives **only if** continuity ships (§9 open item 4).

### 3.5 Unchanged

`dailyLogs` (schema and helpers). `CapacityTier`, `TimeClass`, `TIME_CLASS_MAX_MINUTES`,
`timeClassForMinutes`. `UserPrivate.floorCommitment`, `whyNote`, `weekStartDay`. `protocolSessions`
writes and `reflection.ts` chip sets. All Focus, Energy, and routine screens. `VideoPlayerModal`.
Notification primitives.

### 3.6 Retired

`WeeklyOpenScreen` outcome and capacity steps (the wizard collapses to weekStart + confirm, or
retires wholly if the first cycle is created at onboarding and subsequent ones on rollover — Step-0
of slice 3 decides). `OpenYourWeekCard` as an outcome pick. `resolveWeeklyEntry`'s `'open'` target.
`applyQuickWin`. `WeeklyCycle.outcome` as a read anywhere. `ADJUSTMENT_KEYS` including
`'different-outcome'`. `ComingSoonCard` (no call sites). `downshiftEvents` code (leave data).

### 3.7 New collections must join the deleteAccount list

`journeyStates` and `moments` (§5, slice 8) are added to the `deleteAccount` cleanup set in the same
slice that creates them. The 18-orphaned-collection gap does not grow by two.

---

## 4. Phase resolver (replaces `useWeeklyLanding`'s gate)

```
resolveJourney(uid) →
  { target: 'today',     phase: PhaseContext }
  { target: 'migrate',   legacy: { latestCycle } }     // beta users with weekly history
  { target: 'onboard' }                                 // no state, no history (should not occur post-onboarding)
```

`PhaseContext = { phaseKey, destination, capacitySeed, revisionToken }` replaces the `WeeklyCycle`
argument to `useTodayCard`. `capacitySeed` comes from `UserPrivate` (the onboarding capacity
answer, re-homed off the cycle). `revisionToken` replaces `cycle.closeCompletedAt` as the reload
trigger.

**Migration branch (required state, not a screen in the mockups).** A beta user opens the app with
`weeklyCycles` history and no `journeyStates` doc. Resolver returns `migrate`; the app shows the
route screen (A2) one time with destination derived from the latest cycle's `outcome`
(`stress → calm`), writes `journeyStates` with `phaseKey: 'remove'`, and proceeds. Legacy cycle docs
are never read again and never deleted. Gate: `JOURNEY_IA` flag, following the
`FOUR_PILLAR_IA` / `ONBOARDING_V3` precedent, so main stays walkable throughout.

---

## 5. Build sequence

Standing discipline applies to every slice: read-only Step-0 → build with scope fence and STOP
gates → commit on branch → device walk (`--tunnel`) on any slice with runtime surface → `--no-ff`
merge with two `-m` flags, no backticks in messages. `npm test` in `functions/` before any functions
deploy. Deploy state lives on Kyle's checklist.

| # | Slice | Scope fence | Gates | Walk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Prep: split and rescue** **[Next]** | Move `dailyLogDocId`, `upsertDailyLog`, `getDailyLog`, `hasPickedToday`, `DailyLogInput` from `weeklyCycle.service.ts` into `dailyLog.service.ts`. Move `CAPACITY_LABELS/GLOSSES`, `TIME_LABELS/GLOSSES`, `PICKER_COPY` from `screens/weekly/copy.ts` into `components/dashboard/dailyPicker.copy.ts`. Update imports. **Zero behavior change.** | jest green; import graph shows no daily→weekly edge | No (no runtime change) |
| 1 | **Journey types, state, rules** | `PhaseKey`, `DestinationKey`, `PhaseHistoryEntry`, `JourneyState` in `types/models.ts`; `journeyState.service.ts` (get/create/advance/skip/adjust/recordOffer); `firestore.rules` for `journeyStates` (owner read/write, shape-validated) + rules tests; `deleteAccount` list updated; derivations `deriveConsistentDays`, `deriveCalendarDays`, `deriveAdjustDue` as pure functions with tests. | rules tests pass; **[Kyle-gated]** rules deploy | No |
| 2 | **Resolver + PhaseContext + migration branch** | `resolveJourney`; `useJourneyLanding` replacing `useWeeklyLanding` behind `JOURNEY_IA`; `useTodayCard(uid, phaseContext)`; `DashboardScreen` gate swap; migration branch wiring (route screen reuse deferred to slice 4; interim: write state and land on Today). | Step-0 confirms the four scalar reads are the only seam; STOP if more found | Yes: fresh account, legacy account |
| 3 | **Matrix rekey + re-tag + outcome-pick retirement** | §3.2 in full; `PHASE_DISPLAY` shape with placeholder strings; retire §3.6 items; `WeeklyCycle` write-set reduced per §3.4; analytics events rekeyed (`journey_*` replaces `weekly_open`; `weekly_close` survives renamed `weekly_reset`). | **[Content-gated]** re-tag mapping + at least one `remove` variant per capacity tier, authored as mark-done protocols with why-card text; STOP if unauthored cells would leave any (phase, capacity) empty | Yes: full daily loop across two phases |
| 4 | **Onboarding: destination + route** | A1 copy reframe on step 2; **new** route screen (A2) at step 3 (open item 1); Capacity step copy loses "this week"; terminal write creates `journeyStates` and the first weekly cycle without outcome; `activeOutcome` → `destination`; write order preserved (`completeOnboarding` last). Migration branch now shows A2. | **[Content-gated]** A1/A2 strings, 16 `short` strings | Yes: full arc + migration |
| 5 | **Practices → journey map + Start here container** | B1: `JourneyMapScreen` replaces `PracticesHubScreen` config launcher (same stateless shape); card states from `journeyStates`; phase detail pages re-house Focus hub (refocus), Energy/Stress/Routines/Sleep (recover); `StartHereRow` container over `VideoPlayerModal` with collapsed/expanded state persisted per surface; `explainerPath` data field. | **[Content-gated]** 16 `title` + 16 `gloss` strings; recover internal structure (detail page only; map ships without it) | Yes |
| 6 | **Weekly reset repurpose** | C1: `WeeklyCloseScreen` → one felt read + note; drop ratings and adjustment; write `phaseRead`, `phaseKeyAtRead`; `ContinuityCard` disposition per open item 4. | **[Content-gated]** C1 strings | Yes |
| 7 | **Offers + Today additions** | B2 advancement screen (two copy variants: threshold-met, ceiling-met); C2 adjust screen with per-phase alternatives; offer surfacing rules (Today card day-of, then map; 3-day persistence per open item 3); Today journey line (D1); Today Start here collapsed row; `journey_advance_offered / _accepted / _declined / _skipped`, `journey_adjust_*` events. | **[Content-gated]** B2 ×2, C2 alternatives ×4 phases | Yes |
| 8 | **Moments of joy** | `moments/{uid}_{ts}` collection (rules, deleteAccount), one-tap entry sheet from D1 below-fold row, single-line input, no list surface on Today; feeds nothing until Insights ships. | rules; **[Content-gated]** copy | Yes |
| 9 | **Behavioral protocol screen + remind-later** | The Daily Action Launcher behavioral screen (protocol, why, mark done, remind me later) for `remove` protocols; one-off later-today notification (`scheduleLocalNotification` DATE trigger), `scheduledAt` on `DailyLog`, third card state, cancellation bookkeeping; OS-settings redirect after denial. | Completion semantics decision (mockup v1 E1 open item) | Yes |

**Ordering rationale.** 0 makes everything after it smaller and reversible. 1–2 land the model
behind a flag without touching content. 3 is the content-dependent core and the point of no return
for the outcome axis. 4 follows 3 because onboarding writes the rekeyed shape. 5–7 are the user-
facing surfaces in the order a new user meets them. 8–9 are quality, not structure. Slices 3–7 are
the ones that cannot start until Jen's items land; slices 0–2 can start today.

**Parallel engineering queue, unaffected but interacting:** `userPrivate` migration slices 3–4
(journeyStates rules must be written against the post-flip rules model), `deleteAccount` retention
gap (grows by two collections here), payload logging strip before Sentry reconnection, web signup
fix, a11y and font-scaling slices (the journey map's four titles at Dynamic Type sizes are a test
case). `wellnessScore.service` de-wiring remains queued and is untouched by this build.

---

## 6. Content dependencies (Jen), in build order

Reordered from her Part 12 to match the slice sequence. Items marked ★ are not on her list yet.

1. **Practice re-tag mapping** (slice 3): which existing variants move to `recover` / `refocus`.
2. **Remove protocols** (slice 3): at least one per capacity tier, mark-done shape, with why text.
   Behavioral screen arrives in slice 9; until then these serve on the daily card.
3. **The 48 display strings** (slices 4–5): 16 × `short`, `title`, `gloss`. Alliteration is
   internal; user-facing strings are destination language only.
4. **A1 / A2 copy** (slice 4). A2 is the bait-and-switch mitigation for the whole journey.
5. **Recover's internal structure** (slice 5 detail page). Starting shape: regulate, sleep, fuel,
   movement. Moved to the top of her list; the strings depend on knowing what the phase contains.
6. **C1 weekly reset copy** (slice 6).
7. ★ **B2 advancement copy, two variants** (slice 7): threshold-met (names what held) and
   ceiling-met (nothing to name; door open regardless).
8. ★ **C2 adjust alternatives, 2–3 per phase** (slice 7): constrained choice inside the phase.
9. **Start here videos ×2** (Today: what drives results and why the order; Practices: how the map
   works). Containers ship in slice 5 with a placeholder path; videos are data.
10. **Moments of joy copy** (slice 8).
11. **Rewire prompts** — post slice 9, gated on the crisis pre-check (§7).
12. **Learn deep dives per blocker** — independent of the build; publish as ready.
13. ★ **Confirmed retired:** the 24-cell off-diagonal outcome grid. Do not author.

---

## 7. Kyle's deliverables to Jen

- **The Guide behavior file** (her fourth ask): stance (**assistant, not coach**, in user-facing
  copy; "coach" is reserved for the human practitioner channel), the data-access position (what
  the Guide may read: `journeyStates`, `dailyLogs`, the current phase's content; not journal
  bodies, not `protocolSessions` reflections without explicit opt-in), and the **crisis path**.
- **Crisis pre-check** is confirmed absent on every input path. It is a hard precondition for
  Rewire journaling and for any Guide free-text input. Client-side, before any network call
  (locked decision). Jen owns copy and the resource list; Kyle owns the mechanism and its
  placement in the input pipeline. Sequenced after slice 9, before any Rewire content ships.
- **The two CC reports** as her instance's baseline ("what exists on main"), plus the nine
  spec-only terms and the substitution conflict, stated plainly.

---

## 8. Brand tripwires specific to this build

- **Every practice runnable, always.** "Locked" does not exist in the UI vocabulary. AHEAD opens.
- **No counter, ever, anywhere.** Not the 8, not the 14, not the two weekly reads, not days-in-
  phase, not phases-complete. Derivations stay in code. The advancement screen names practices.
- **Framework words stay internal.** `remove | recover | rewire | refocus` are keys and file names.
  `brandCopyGuard` should flag them in any user-facing string module.
- **State at input, silent after.** The weekly read routes the adjust offer and then disappears.
  It never appears in a summary or is echoed back.
- **Adjust offers lead with fit, never with the person.** "The practice isn't the right fit, not
  that you are."
- **Declining is a peer action.** "Stay a while longer" and "keep going as is" have zero
  friction and generate no follow-up nag; re-offer only on the next threshold or read.
- **Start here collapses.** Today's three-card ceiling: hero, Start here (collapsed row), the
  advancement card when live. The journey line is a text row, not a card.
- **Moments of joy is one tap, optional, never counted.** "Gratitude" appears nowhere.
- **No em dashes in user-facing copy. Coral for genuine errors only. Reduce Motion respected.**

## 9. Open items carried (decide before the slice that needs them)

| # | Item | Needed by | Lean |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Route screen position: step 3 (after destination) vs Jen's step 5 | Slice 4 | Step 3 |
| 2 | Ceiling-met advancement copy register | Slice 7 | Honest, no practices named, door open |
| 3 | Advancement card persistence on Today | Slice 7 | 3 days, then map only |
| 4 | Continuity: ship (floor question survives in C1) or retire | Slice 6 | Retire for beta; revisit with data |
| 5 | Adjust counter re-arm after "keep going as is" | Slice 7 | Re-arm; copy acknowledges the prior choice |
| 6 | Today journey line: `short` string vs a stage word | Slice 7 | `short` |
| 7 | Evening-protocol completion semantics (commit-time vs follow-through) | Slice 9 | Commit-time |
| 8 | `WeeklyOpenScreen`: collapse to weekStart+confirm, or retire and create cycles on rollover | **RESOLVED Sept 1: retire; rollover creation is a slice 3b requirement** (under JOURNEY_IA the weekly open is unreachable, so expired weeks must self-renew or the weekly reset ritual dies) | — |
| 9 | "Steadier days" vs "Routines" as the destination label | Slice 4 | Jen's call |

---

## 10. Freeze

Per Jen's Part 11, adopted here as build policy: **the architecture in §1–§4 is frozen** until ten
beta users have used it and reported. Anything structural arriving from either founder goes on the
post-beta list (§11) with a round assignment, not into a slice. Copy, content, and bug fixes are
not structural. The test for "structural": does it change §1, §3, or §4? If yes, it waits.

---

## 11. Post-beta list

Reframe layer in Insights (early Rewire touches) · Insights data view · `protocolSessions` read
path · Rewire full phase (gated on crisis pre-check, may land in beta if 9 and the pre-check ship) ·
Referral rewards · Aging photo (declined, recorded so it is not re-raised) · Habit removal (value
moves to Insights) · Calendar sync · Org entitlement resolver · `weeklyEngine` rename pass (now:
`journeyEngine` naming lands with slice 3; residual renames after) · Offline-resilience slice ·
Start-day edit surface · Coach 500 fix · B2B2C coach channel.

---

## 12. Working notes

- Two-track discipline holds. Claude.ai authors slice prompts and reviews every CC report before
  merge. Kyle bridges and holds the ledger.
- Every slice prompt states which §9 items it needs decided and STOPs if they are not.
- Docs to true up once slices 3–5 are walked: Canonical Positioning Brief (tabs, the check-in
  vocabulary, the journey as method not pitch), Messaging Pillars (weights unchanged; pillars are
  acquisition vocabulary, phases are in-app), CLAUDE.md precedence ladder (this doc enters above
  the Today/IA v2 roadmap).

---

## 13. Build log (amendments as slices close)

**Sept 1, 2026 — slices 0–2 merged; main at ff8939e; JOURNEY_IA shipped ON.**
- Baselines: tsc 149 · jest 2953 / 201 · rules 183 pass / 2 skip · functions 25 / 3 ·
  sentinel 189. (Earlier figures in prompts were stale; these are measured.)
- Deploys completed Sept 1: `dailyLogs (userId ASC, date ASC)` index · `journeyStates`
  rules · functions (deleteAccount sweep includes `journeyStates`).
- Slice 1 model fix: `JourneyState.userId` added (see §3.1); without it the
  deleteAccount sweep matches nothing.
- Slice 2 shims, removal schedule: `legacyOutcomeFor` (destination→OutcomeKey) is
  removed in **slice 3a**; the capacitySeed-from-latest-cycle shim is re-homed in
  **slice 4** (slice 2's code comments carry both dates).
- **Slice 3 is split**: **3a** engine re-key + re-tag + shim removal (content-gated on
  Remove protocols before merge); **3b** weekly write-set reduction + `WeeklyOpenScreen`
  retirement + rollover cycle creation (open item 8, resolved).
- Under JOURNEY_IA the weekly open is unreachable by design; between 3a and 3b an
  expired-week beta account has no weekly ritual. Accepted for the window; 3b closes it.
- `deleteAccount` gap is larger than the tracked 18: slice 1 Step-0 found seven more
  behavioral collections absent from the sweep (`dailyLogs`, `weeklyCycles`,
  `downshiftEvents`, `dayBlocks`, `capturedTasks`, `brainStateCheckIns`,
  `protocolSessions`). Own slice before beta; privacy-policy 30-day promise depends on it.
- Walk protocol correction: device walks are Kyle's; every slice ends at "commit, hand
  Kyle the walk script, STOP." CC never reports walk results it did not observe.
- `chore/legacy-removal` verified fully contained in main; deleted.

**Sept 2, 2026 — slice 3a merged (be58b97). Engine speaks PhaseKey natively.**
- Jen's three behavioral Remove protocols live; rewire cells placeholder and
  unreachable until slice 5. Retag confirmed by Jen (12 rows, zero edits);
  real-content walk passed all three tiers.
- Retired with the slice: applyQuickWin, countWeeklyCyclesForOutcome, week-number
  plumbing, reshapeParity (superseded by retagParity). Why-copy on Remove variants
  is held unrendered until the slice 9 behavioral screen.
- Baselines: jest **2953 / 200**, sentinel **189**, tsc 149. *(Measured on be58b97.
  The draft of this entry read 2988 / 203 and sentinel 192; both were wrong and are
  corrected here rather than recorded, because the next slice's Step 0 keys off these.
  Suites went 201 → 200: THREE retired — useTodayCard.weekNumber, quickWin,
  reshapeParity — and TWO added, protocolMatrix.removeCellsAuthored and retagParity.
  The sentinel did not move because it counts DRAFTED strings: Jen's content is
  approved, carries no `COPY: draft` marker, and replaced placeholders that carried
  none either.)*
- Walk finding (Sept 2): DailyPickerSheet's time question has been invisible since
  3b-ii-b — sticky footer over an unaffordanced scroll; JSDOM suites cannot catch
  layout occlusion. Fix slice queued (compress time to a chip row, §5.2 fade on
  EnhancedModal): must land before any cell gains multiple time-length variants.
  Standing note: device walks are the only net for layout-class bugs.
- Remove framework finalized with Jen (three drafts, two rounds): three protocol
  families (behavioral/mental/interpersonal), replace-not-just-remove routing,
  one-move-before-building, curated-strings-only rule (free text never enters
  template copy), crisis pre-check promoted to a 3c-i precondition. Slice 3c split:
  3c-i capture + families + pre-check; 3c-ii replacement pick + routine seed.
- Resolved: advance-offer decline suppresses 7 days, re-offers once, then map-only.
  "It varies" timing routes scaffold-only (no routine seed). Acknowledgment
  rotation with consistency-derived quieting is 3c-i scope.
- Open: helper line (Kyle) — his definition, Jen's decision rule, or the combo.

*Living document. Owner: Kyle. Update as slices close; do not edit §1–§4 during the freeze.*
