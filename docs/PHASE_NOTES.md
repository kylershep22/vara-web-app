# Vara Implementation — Working Notes Per Phase

Carry-over reminders that surface during one phase but apply to a later phase.
Each phase reads its section before starting work.

---

## Phase 1

### Sub-step 1: schema lock landed

`models.ts` now defines `Protocol`, the `ProtocolStep` discriminated union
(`breath` | `audio` | `instruction` | `timer`), `BreathPhase`, `EvidenceTier`,
`TimeOfDay`, `ProtocolModality`, and `ProtocolFamily` (closed set of 11 launch
families; Bellows Breath excluded). `protocolIdNormalizer` mirrors the
Phase 0 `brainStateNormalizer` pattern and resolves legacy ids:

- `extended-exhale` → `extended-exhale`
- `micro-reset` → `sensory-reset`
- `activating-breathwork`, `gratitude-clarity`, `focus-primer` → `null`

Call sites must handle `null` as "protocol no longer available" — do not
fabricate a substitute.

### Sub-step 2: static data populated

`constants/brainStateProtocols.ts` now contains all 16 launch variants
keyed by id (always-suffix scheme: `{family}-{minutes}`). The dict is
typed via `satisfies Record<string, Protocol>` so `ProtocolId` resolves
to the literal union of variant ids. Data validated by 41 assertions in
`constants/__tests__/brainStateProtocols.test.ts`.

Decisions encoded in the data:

- Box Breathing `durationSeconds = 128` (8 complete cycles × 16s),
  user-facing label still "2 min" via `timeWindow`. Other breath
  protocols sum exactly to their duration. Test enforces "every breath
  step is a whole-cycle multiple."
- Focused Work Window: two variants only (45 / 90), both in the 45-min
  time window. `focused-work-90` only surfaces in `mid_morning` and
  `midday` time-of-day; `focused-work-45` extends through
  `early_afternoon`.
- NSDR audio paths: `nsdr/nsdr_10min_v1.mp3`, `nsdr/nsdr_20min_v1.mp3`.
  Test enforces the `nsdr/nsdr_{min}min_v{ver}.mp3` shape.
- LEGACY_PROTOCOL_ID_MAP updated for the new ids:
  `extended-exhale → extended-exhale-2`, `micro-reset → sensory-reset-2`.
- `getProtocolForState(state)` retained as a deprecated Phase 1
  transitional helper that returns the first state-matching variant in
  library iteration order. Phase 2 swaps the existing call sites
  (`brainStateCheckIn.service.ts`, `useDashboard.ts`,
  `OnboardingV2CheckInScreen.tsx`, `OnboardingV2ProtocolScreen.tsx`)
  over to the new check-in loop. `TodaysProtocolCard.tsx` already
  consumes the new `Protocol` shape via `utils/protocolDisplay.ts`.

### Sub-step 3: primitives landed (BreathPacer + audio loader)

**BreathPacer** at `components/protocol/BreathPacer.tsx`. Self-contained
primitive: takes a `BreathStep` and an optional `startAtScheduleIndex`,
walks the schedule via `setTimeout`, animates the scale via Reanimated 4
shared values, and surfaces phase boundaries to the parent via
`onPhaseChange`/`onComplete`. Pause/resume is owned by the parent: pause =
unmount, resume = remount with the saved index. The pure schedule logic
lives in `utils/breathPacerSchedule.ts` (computes 16-cycle / 8-cycle /
30-cycle entry lists for the launch breath protocols) and is fully
unit-tested.

Reduce Motion path: when `useReducedMotion()` is true, renders a static
silver-sage circle with a numeric countdown (driven by a 250ms
setInterval) instead of the animated teal circle. Phase label still
updates. Verify on device by toggling iOS Settings > Accessibility >
Motion > Reduce Motion.

**protocolAudioLoader** at `services/audio/protocolAudioLoader.ts`.
Three exports:
- `prefetchProtocolAudio(audioPath)` — call from Protocol Detail screen
  mount; resolves URL + warms the platform HTTP cache by briefly opening
  and immediately unloading an `Audio.Sound`. Non-fatal: any error is
  logged and swallowed.
- `loadProtocolAudio(audioPath)` — returns a fully-loaded `Audio.Sound`
  ready to play. Caller owns the lifetime (must call `unloadAsync()`
  in cleanup). Throws a user-friendly error on failure.
- In-memory `urlCache: Map<audioPath, downloadUrl>`. Keyed by audioPath;
  versioned filenames handle invalidation. Cache lives for the JS bundle
  lifetime (cleared on app restart / hot reload).

Path convention: `audioPath` is relative to the `protocolAudio/` root
in Firebase Storage. The full Storage path is constructed by prepending
`protocolAudio/`. Test enforces this.

**Dev test screens** at `screens/_dev/`:
- `BreathPacerTestScreen.tsx` — preset selector for the four breath
  protocols + a 6-second short-cycle preset, restart button, phase log,
  reduce-motion indicator. Mount anywhere via temporary navigator
  route while testing.
- `ProtocolAudioLoaderTestScreen.tsx` — preset paths, prefetch / load /
  play / pause / reset buttons, ms-timed log, cache size readout, on-screen
  verification checklist. Requires a stub clip uploaded to
  `protocolAudio/nsdr/nsdr_10min_v1.mp3` (founder action).

Both screens are gated by directory naming (`_dev/`) — easy to spot
and remove before TestFlight. They are not referenced by the navigator
yet; the founder wires a temporary route while testing on device.

### Sub-step 4 — landed

Player composition shipped across 4.3.1 → 4.3.4. Summary:

- **`utils/sessionMarker.ts`** — AsyncStorage marker module, 19 tests.
- **`utils/playerReducer.ts`** — pure reducer with discriminated
  PlayerStatus union; 52 tests including audio_error transitions.
- **`hooks/useStepCountdown.ts`** — shared countdown hook for
  Instruction/Timer leaves; 10 tests including the inline-arrow
  callback regression.
- **Leaves**: `BreathPacer`, `AudioStepView`, `InstructionStepView`,
  `TimerStepView`. AudioStepView has a `__DEV__`-gated "Force audio
  error" button for the test screen.
- **Transport + modal**: `PlayerTransport` (bottom-pinned bar) +
  `EndEarlyConfirmModal` (centered modal). Verb-aligned ("End early"),
  Soft Coral destructive treatment, 48px touch targets, light haptics
  on Pause/Resume + Back-15s + End early.
- **`GuidedSessionPlayer`** — composes everything. Mount-only
  recovery effect with 30s timeout, ref-driven handler, single-key
  marker preservation on parent rejection. Header X dispatches
  user_exit always; transport End early dispatches audio_error in
  error state.
- **Dev test harness**: `screens/_dev/GuidedSessionPlayerTestScreen`
  with protocol picker, recovery fixture options (none / happy /
  expired / corrupt), real mount/unmount semantics for the player,
  on-device verification checklist.

Phase 1 sweep at sub-step 4.3.4 close: **299/299 tests across 14
suites**. tsc baseline unchanged at 181 pre-existing errors.

### Sub-step 4 deferred-to-Phase-6

- FWW notifications silence — flagged here, not implemented. Adding
  `expo-notifications.setNotificationHandler` is invasive; user can
  rely on system Focus mode for now.
- AppState background-lifecycle handling — not implemented. Phase 1
  recovers force_quit via the AsyncStorage marker on next mount; brief
  app backgrounding is not detected as abandonment.
- "Skippable after first use" orientation — every Phase 1 session
  shows the brief idle-state orientation. Tracking which protocols
  the user has seen before is Phase 6 polish.

### Sub-step 4.4 entry checklist — device verification

Before sub-step 4.4 begins, the founder runs the on-device
verification checklist baked into
`GuidedSessionPlayerTestScreen.tsx`. Seven scenarios cover the major
production code paths (happy completion, audio-error transport flow,
Try again loop, header X exit, three recovery fixtures).

Sub-step 4.4 itself is targeted-test or device-fix-only depending on
what device verification surfaces. Per founder direction: no
additional integration tests beyond the 14 already in
`GuidedSessionPlayer.test.tsx` unless device verification reveals a
gap.

### Sub-step 5: audio path convention

Audio steps reference Firebase Storage paths relative to `protocolAudio/`.
NSDR variants ship as versioned mp3 files per
`docs/Vara_NSDR_Audio_Scripts.md`:
- `nsdr/nsdr_10min_v1.mp3`
- `nsdr/nsdr_20min_v1.mp3`

The audio loader can stub against a short test clip uploaded to Storage
until production NSDR audio lands; do not block sub-step 4 player work
on production audio.

## Phase 2

### Firestore rules deploy required before first write

The `protocolSessions/{sessionId}` rules block was added in Phase 0 but
**not deployed.** Phase 2 is the first phase that writes to this collection.

Before any Phase 2 code path writes a `ProtocolSession` doc, run:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

If the deploy is missed, writes will fail with `FirebaseError: Missing or
insufficient permissions` and existing TestFlight users will hit the error
during the new check-in loop.

Surfaced: Phase 0 wrap-up.

### Doc-ID convention for `protocolSessions`

Per the Phase 0 rules-block comment: auto-generated IDs (multiple sessions per
user per day are expected, unlike `brainStateCheckIns` which uses
`{userId}_{date}`). Use `addDoc()` rather than `setDoc()` with a constructed ID.

### Backlog files to sweep

- `docs/VOICE_AUDIT_BACKLOG.md` — brand-voice issues surfaced during rename and
  feature work.
- `docs/TEST_INFRASTRUCTURE_BACKLOG.md` — Jest config and test environment
  issues.

Both are appended to as work progresses; Phase 6 closes them out.
